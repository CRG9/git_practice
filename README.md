This is the README.txt for my GitHub Practice Project on Codecademy.

This project is a silly exercise for generating random phrases.

To run the program, ensure you have Node.js installed on your device.

From there, download this package and store it on a folder on your desktop.

Once downloaded, navigate to the folder in Node.

When you are ready to run the program, type "node main.js" in node to see the random phrase generated!
